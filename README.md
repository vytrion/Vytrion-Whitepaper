OmniNet: A next-generation internet architecture and protocol layer.

OmniNet Protocol — v2.0
A New Internet Architecture for Identity, Intelligence, and Holographic Computing

OmniNet is a next-generation internet layer designed to unify identity, data, knowledge, intelligence, and global communication into a single user-owned ecosystem.

What Is OmniNet?

OmniNet replaces the fragmented, centralized, surveillance-driven structure of today’s internet with a unified, privacy-first architecture built on:

Identity (OmniID)

Encrypted personal data (OmniVault)

Semantic knowledge graph (OmniGraph)

Holographic multi-modal UI (OmniUI)

Multi-device sync (OmniSync)

Device mesh networking (OmniMesh)

New communication protocol (OmniProtocol)

Distributed compute (HyperStructures)

Global routing layer (PrimeNet)

Trust-based value system (OmniEconomy)

Developer SDK (OmniNet SDK)

OmniNet is not a blockchain, not a cloud service, and not a traditional OS.
It is a new internet layer designed for the age of AI, AR, holographic computing, and distributed intelligence.
